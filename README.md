# Advance SQL PROJECT--INSTAGRAM-LIKE DATABASE SCHEMA
In this exercise, I'll be working with a simplified version of an Instagram-like database schema. This schema represents the core components of a social media platform where users can post photos, like, comment, follow others, and more. As part of my learning journey, I'll be using a range of advanced SQL functions, including window functions, grouping, and subqueries, to perform intricate data analysis tasks on the provided database. These functions enable me to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets, enhancing my ability to work with real-world scenarios

## Database Schema Overview:

Here's a brief overview of the tables I'll be working with: users: Contains user information such as usernames and creation timestamps.

photos: Stores details about posted photos, including image URLs and user IDs.

comments: Stores comments made on photos, along with associated user and photo IDs.

likes: Tracks user likes on photos.

follows: Records user follow relationships.

tags: Manages unique tag names for photos.

photo_tags: Links photos with associated tags.

## Objective

The task is to write SQL queries using a variety of advanced functions to extract valuable insights from the database. These insights could be used by the platform to understand user behavior, engagement, and trends. Each question is accompanied by a description of the task.

This project served as a platform to enhance my proficiency in advanced SQL analytics, demonstrating the practical applications of these concepts. I had the freedom to experiment, collaborate, and explore diverse approaches to problem-solving.

## Questions :

1.How many times does the average user post?

2.Find the top 5 most used hashtags.

3.Find users who have liked every single photo on the site.

4.Retrieve a list of users along with their usernames and the rank of their account creation, ordered by the creation date in ascending order.

5.List the comments made on photos with their comment texts, photo URLs, and usernames of users who posted the comments. Include the comment count for each photo

6.For each tag, show the tag name and the number of photos associated with that tag. Rank the tags by the number of photos in descending order.

7.List the usernames of users who have posted photos along with the count of photos they have posted. Rank them by the number of photos in descending order.

8.Display the username of each user along with the creation date of their first posted photo and the creation date of their next posted photo.

9.For each comment, show the comment text, the username of the commenter, and the comment text of the previous comment made on the same photo.

10.Show the username of each user along with the number of photos they have posted and the number of photos posted by the user before them and after them, based on the creation date.
